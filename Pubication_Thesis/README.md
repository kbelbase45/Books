# My_Publications
This repository contains the publications that relate to my doctoral project and the project I carried out to complete my master’s degree thesis.

[1] "Stress tensor in the linearized augmented plane wave method"<br/>
<br/>
This paper contains the theoretical description and the mathematical formulas that I derived and implemented in WIEN2k code: a full potential all electron code which consider to be the one of most accurate code for electronic structure calculation. In this work in particular the electrostatic part of the stress tensor, which is related to the electrostatic interaction between all charged particles in the system, was derived differently than in previous methods. In addition, a simplification of an integration within the unit cell and the so-called core correction are also solved differently. This is a main project of my PhD thesis and its extension for GGA and for different linearization technique (APW+lo) are included in the second work.

[2] "Stress tensor in the linearized augmented plane wave method II: Extension to APW+lo and GGA"<br/>
<br/>
Since the first paper was limited to the Linearized Augmented Plane Wave Method (LAPW) and Local Density Approximation (LDA), a further derivation had to be made for APW + lo and GGA. The analytical formulas derived in this way have been implemented and a further study that was carried out to validate such an implementation is summarized in this second paper. This paper was submitted to Physical Review B and is currently under review.

[3] "Symmetry-Adapted Finite Strain Landau Theory Applied to KMnF3"<br/>
This is a collaborative project and my role on this project was to run simulations to generate data.<br/>

[4] "Finite-strain Landau theory applied to the high-pressure phase transition of lead titanate"<br/>
Similar to 3, my role on this project was to run simulations to generate data as it is also a collaborative project.<br/>

[5] "First-principles study of the interaction of hydrogen molecular on Na-adsorbed graphene"<br/>
<br/>
I carried out this project as part of my thesis as part of my master’s degree with a major in physics. For this project, a two-dimensional material (graphene) is first taken, a sodium atom is added on the surface of the graphene and the graphene + sodium system is theoretically relaxed with the quantum ESPRESSO package: a package based on pseudopotentials to calculate the electronic structure . During the relaxation process, a certain amount of charge is transferred from the sodium atom to the graphene surface, as a result of which the conical band structure of pure graphene has shifted below the Fermi level in the graphene-sodium system. In addition, the graphene + sodium system is being researched by adding hydrogen molecules for its possible application as a hydrogen storage material. Later calculations are carried out by including Van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the density functional theory as a DFT-D2 approach.
